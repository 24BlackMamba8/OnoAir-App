## Code Review

### Functionality

#### **Preservation**
- **Module:** `home.component.ts`
- **Comment:** The `openEditDialog` function effectively utilizes Angular Material Dialog for in-place editing of flight details. The seamless update of `lastMinuteFlights` ensures real-time UI updates without requiring a full page reload, which enhances user experience.

#### **Improvement**
- **Module:** `home.component.ts`
- **Comment:** In the `bookFlight` method, the `id` field in the `Order` object is assigned a randomly generated string, but the `Order` model defines `id` as a number. This discrepancy could lead to type-related issues. It should be changed to match the model definition.

### Standards

#### **Preservation**
- **Module:** `header.component.ts`
- **Code Segment:**
  ```typescript
  toggleDropdown(dropdownKey: string): void {
    this.dropdownOpen[dropdownKey] = !this.dropdownOpen[dropdownKey];
  }
  ```
- **Comment:** The use of a dynamic key in `toggleDropdown` follows best practices for managing multiple dropdowns dynamically, making the code more scalable and easier to maintain.

#### **Improvement**
- **Module:** `home.component.ts`
- **Code Segment:**
  ```typescript
  import { OrderService } from 'src/app/services/orders.service';
  ```
- **Comment:** The file is imported as `orders.service`, but the standard naming convention for Angular services suggests using `order.service.ts` to maintain consistency with other service files.
