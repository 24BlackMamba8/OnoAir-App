## Code Review

**Topic:**
	        	                                           
**1. Home screen, help, header, footer**

 **Functionality**

#### **Preservation**
- **Module:** `home.component.ts`
- **Comment:** The `openEditDialog` function effectively utilizes Angular Material Dialog for in-place editing of flight details. The seamless update of `lastMinuteFlights` ensures real-time UI updates without requiring a full page reload, which enhances user experience.

#### **Improvement**
- **Module:** `home.component.ts`
- **Comment:** In the `bookFlight` method, the `id` field in the `Order` object is assigned a randomly generated string, but the `Order` model defines `id` as a number. This discrepancy could lead to type-related issues. It should be changed to match the model definition.

### Standards

#### **Preservation**
- **Module:** `header.component.ts`
- **Code Segment:**
  ```typescript
  toggleDropdown(dropdownKey: string): void {
    this.dropdownOpen[dropdownKey] = !this.dropdownOpen[dropdownKey];
  }
  ```
- **Comment:** The use of a dynamic key in `toggleDropdown` follows best practices for managing multiple dropdowns dynamically, making the code more scalable and easier to maintain.

#### **Improvement**
- **Module:** `home.component.ts`
- **Code Segment:**
  ```typescript
  import { OrderService } from 'src/app/services/orders.service';
  ```
- **Comment:** The file is imported as `orders.service`, but the standard naming convention for Angular services suggests using `order.service.ts` to maintain consistency with other service files.

| Home screen | ✅ | ✅ | `home.component.ts` |

## **Topic:
2. Flights - screens + service Functionality Review**

### Preservation
- **Flight Management Module (flight-management.component.ts)**
  - The system effectively implements a **dialog-based flight editing system**, allowing seamless modifications of flight details.
  - **Unique Feature:** The `editFlight` function updates the flight list dynamically after dialog closure, ensuring real-time updates.

### Improvement
- **Flight Management Module (flight-management.component.ts)**
  - **Bug:** In the flight data array, `Arrival` is capitalized instead of `arrival`, which could cause issues when rendering or processing flight data.
  - **Improvement:** The `addFlight` method generates a new ID by finding the max existing ID and incrementing it. This could cause duplication issues if flights are removed. Consider using a UUID or a backend-generated ID.

## Standards Review

### Preservation
- **Flight Management Module (flight-management.component.ts)**
  - The component follows **Angular’s standalone component structure**, properly using `imports` instead of `NgModule` declarations.
  - Uses **MatDialog** efficiently for modal interactions, following Material Design best practices.

### Improvement
- **Flight Management Module (flight-management.component.ts)**
  - **Standard Violation:** The `flights` array is hardcoded in the component. It is recommended to **fetch data from a service** to separate concerns and follow Angular’s best practices for state management.
  - **Standard Violation:** Unused imports (`FlightAddFormComponent` and `FlightEditFormComponent` are commented out). Consider removing them if not required to keep the code clean.
